# Analyzing Alzheimer's and Its Risk Factors

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease by exploring patient demographic, medical, and lifestyle data. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques, we aim to identify key risk factors, provide insights for early detection, and recommend strategies for patient care.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Includes cleaning and organizing patient datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes correlations between various factors (e.g., age, BMI, cognitive function) and Alzheimer's risk.
- **Risk Factor Identification**: Highlights obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and depression as key contributors to Alzheimerâ€™s risk.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilized Random Forest to validate insights and improve prediction accuracy.
